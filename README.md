# Release process for independent Quarkus repositories

This repository is not about releasing the main Quarkus repository (which is handled [here](https://github.com/quarkus-release/release)),
it is about releasing all the independent Quarkus repositories such as Quarkus HTTP, Quarkus Security or Gizmo.
